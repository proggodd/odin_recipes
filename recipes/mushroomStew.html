    <h2>How To Make mushroom Stew</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious, hearty, vegetarian mushroom stew recipe. I serve it with polenta, but it would be equally yummy ladled over mashed potatoes, sweet mashed potatoes, or rice. Garnish with fresh herbs.</p>
     <h2>ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>½ ounce dried mushrooms (such as porcini)</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cloves</li>
        <li>2 pounds assorted fresh mushrooms, cut into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and chopped</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable stock, or as needed</li>
        <li>8 ounces instant polenta</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley, or as desired</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li> Place dried mushrooms in a small bowl with enough hot water to cover; let stand 20 minutes. Drain mushrooms; reserve liquid.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in garlic, thyme, and cloves; cook and stir 2 minutes more. Stir fresh mushrooms and soaked dried mushrooms into onion mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms are soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir tomatoes and reserved mushroom liquid into mushroom mixture; simmer over low heat until thickened, about 20 minutes.        </li>        
        <li>Bring vegetable stock to a boil; whisk in polenta. Cook polenta, whisking constantly, until polenta is thick and stock is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide polenta into 4 bowls; ladle mushroom stew over polenta and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>cook's note:</h2>
     <p>You can stir a small handful of fresh herbs into polenta after cooking if desired.</p>
